                    This study investigates the influence of organizational and management factors on the performance of Sidama Bunna Football Club, employing a cross-sectional survey design. The research involved 44 participants, including players, coaches, managers, and board members, selected through comprehensive sampling. Data analysis utilized Pearson correlation and multiple regression at a 0.05 significance level. Results reveal significant positive correlations between club performance and variables such as strategic factors (r=0.788, p<0.001), communication (r=0.779, p<0.001), human resources (r=0.774, p<0.001), material resources (r=0.699, p<0.01), and finance (r=0.765, p<0.001). Conversely, club structure (r=0.291, p>0.05) showed no significant relationship with performance. Regression analysis demonstrates that strategic factors and finance are critical predictors, with RÂ² indicating that 79.4% of performance variance is explained by the combined model. ANOVA results (F(6,37)=23.745, p<0.001) reinforce the significance of these factors. Strategic planning and financial stability emerged as dominant contributors to performance, overshadowing communication, human resources, and material resources in the combined model. The findings underscore the importance of integrated strategies that prioritize robust financial systems and strategic alignment to enhance club outcomes. This research contributes to understanding sports management in Ethiopian football, highlighting areas requiring organizational improvement and resource allocation.
